analysis of titanic data survivals, I used randomforestregressor and logistic regression to classify cases.

the data set is from kaggle, the accuracy is %76 which is good for one analysis,

a way to increase accuracy is changing the split of train,test or including another variable, which I dropped earlier during data cleaning process ('Embarked').
I used, seaborn for visualizing
pandas and numpy for data cleaning.
sklearn for model building.
